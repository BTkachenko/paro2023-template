    Scenario:
    As a player, I can roll the dice to move my game piece around the board.
    As a player, I can buy unowned property that I land on by paying the bank the price listed on the property's space.
    As a player, I can collect rent from other players who land on my property.
    As a player, I can be sent to jail if I land on the "Go to Jail" space, roll doubles three times in a row, or draw a "Go to Jail" card from the Chance or Community Chest.

    4 acceptance tests:
        GIVEN a player's turn,
        WHEN the player rolls the dice,
        THEN their game piece should move forward the number of spaces that matches the sum of the dice.

        GIVEN a player who lands on an unowned property,
        WHEN they choose to buy the property,
        THEN the player should pay the bank the price of the property and receive the property title deed card.

        GIVEN a player who owns a property,
        WHEN another player lands on their property,
        THEN the owner should collect rent from that player, with the amount determined by the property's rent value.

        GIVEN a player who lands on the "Go to Jail" space, rolls doubles three times in a row, or draws a "Go to Jail" card,
        WHEN these events occur,
        THEN the player should move their game piece directly to the Jail space and their turn ends.
